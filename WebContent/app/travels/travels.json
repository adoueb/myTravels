Amed refers to a long stretch of coast running from the village of Cucik about 14 km eastwards incorporating the seven villages of Amed, Jemeluk, Bunutan, Lipah, Selang, Banyuning and Aas. The pace of life here is slow and the coastal scenery quite stunning making Amed the perfect place for a relaxed holiday in Bali."},

The stretch of coastline from Manggis through Candidasa town itself and east to Bugbug, is normally just referred to as Candidasa. This is a laid back and very relaxing area of Bali with a wide range of accommodation options. Many visitors, especially Europeans, combine a stay in the hotspots of south Bali with a more relaxed break here. The black sand beaches are very narrow and often disappear altogether at high tide."},

Set a 45-minute drive inland from Padang Bai and an hour from Candi Dasa, Sideman straddles one of the many agricultural valleys that form the ramp up to the imposing peak of volcanic Gunung Agung. While it is primarily a rice growing area, there's all manner of other crops and nurseries in the area — including chillies (which we don't recommend eating whole). There's also a temple at the summit of a very steep set of stairs that offers tremendous views, a scenic river flowing through the valley floor and ample opportunity for both trekking (while other spots are more convenient, you can organise an ascent of Gunung Agung from Sideman) and just more easy-going wanders through the ricefields."},
